                <h1>Faqs</h1>
                <h2>General</h2>
                <h4>Is mednear a phermacy?</h4>
                <p>No, MedNear helps you connect to the partnered pharmacy that can fulfill your order. We partner with verified pharmacies, which work with registered pharmacists.</p>
                <h4>So, how will I get my medicines?</h4>
                <p>The prescription that you provide to us is validated by a team of pharmacists and is then passed on to a pharmacy in your vicinity. The sale of medicines can only be done by a licensed pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist.</p>
                <h4>How does my prescription get validated?</h4>
                <p>We check if a registered medical practitioner has generated the prescription. We then look at the date of visit and duration of medication, to check if the prescription has expired. We also check if the quantity of medicines ordered matches with the prescription.</p>
                <h4>If I upload a prescription, will my order be confirmed immediately?</h4>
                <p>No. After we validate the prescription, our vendor will then confirm the stock availability. We will send you a SMS, email and Push Notification, if we are unable to fulfill some medicines. As a lead generation platform, we only connect you to the pharmacy - which after due verification of credentials and your prescription - may confirm your order. Please read the terms and conditions of the App and website.</p>
                <h4>Will I need the original prescription at time of delivery?</h4>
                <p>Yes. As per the government regulations, patient must be in possession of the original prescription at the time of delivery. So keep it handy when our delivery personnel comes to visit you.</p>
                <h4>Why do the prices of medicine vary?</h4>

                <h4>Why are there multiple pages for the same medicine?</h4>

                <h4>What is a generic substitute?</h4>
                <p>Substitutes depend on the composition and strength of constituent salts. Substitute are medicines made by other manufactures using the same salt composition as your prescribed medicine .These medicines are often more affordable. Please note that substitutes change with the salt strength, even for same medicine name.</p>
                <h4>Can I just buy another medicine listed as substitute?</h4>
                <p>Yes, you can buy other substitutes if you prescription lists the salt names instead of a brand name. You can always encourage your doctor to write salt names on your prescription instead of a specific brand name.</p>
                <h4>Where can I check my order status?</h4>
                <p>You will receive regular SMS,Emails and Push notification about your order. You can also track your order from your order history section. If there is any delay or change in your order, our customer care will call and inform you.</p>
